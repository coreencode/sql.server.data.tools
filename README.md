A client tool is required for any SQL Server DBA, Developer, or end-user to connect to SQL Server and utilize its functionalities. This is where  SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) helps you. You can leverage SSDT to create database projects in Visual Studio.


## What are Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools?

Microsoft’s SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) is a Visual Studio development solution for developing SQL Server relational databases. SSDT is a broader term that includes more than simply new database tools. It’s essentially a repackaging of the Business Intelligence Developer Studio (BIDS) product from Visual Studio 2008. In addition to the new database tools, SSDT supports the conventional BIDS project types for SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), Reporting Services (SSRS), and Integration Services (SSIS). As a result of SSDT, Microsoft has now consolidated all SQL Server database development experiences into a single Visual Studio edition.

## Key Features of SQL Server Data Tools

SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) effectively merge multiple distinct development features that were previously present in separate tools into a single integrated programming environment.SQL Server Data Tools effectively merges multiple distinct development features that were previously present in separate tools into a single integrated programming environment. Let’s take a glance at the significant features of SQL Server Data Tools.

* **Declarative Schema-Based Database Design:** The database schema is the final specification of the database in SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT). The schema itself is version-controlled, making it easier to design and manage numerous database versions. SSDT can build the scripts needed to deploy new database versions automatically, eliminating the need to manually prepare lots of new ALTER scripts for each new version. It can also be used in both connected and disconnected modes.


* **Reverse Engineer Databases:** You can either build a new database from scratch or import an existing database and begin making changes to the schema. You can also import the schema of an existing database into SSDT.


* **Schema and Data Comparison:** SSDT’s schema and data comparison tools are direct successors of Visual Studio for Database Professionals. This feature allows you to compare the schemas of two databases and display all discrepancies. You can quickly determine the differences between your test and production databases.  It can also develop and run the T-SQL scripts needed to reconcile any differences discovered.


* **Generate XML Reports:** SSDT can also be used for all BI development projects, including Integration Services, Analysis Services, and Reporting Services, and is more than simply a relational database development tool. A.dacpac file is generated every time you build the solution (or publish, which triggers a build). It contains all of the information about the database schema. You can create an XML report with all the modifications that will be deployed when a publish is run using the software sqlpackage.exe.


* **Refactor Code:** Refactoring is also supported by SSDT. It comes with a restricted range of SQL Refactoring options. When you rename a table, for example, the name of the table in objects referencing the table is likewise changed
